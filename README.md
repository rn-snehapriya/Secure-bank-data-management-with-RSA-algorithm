# Secure-bank-data-management-with-RSA-algorithm

This Project is submitted by ***R N SNEHA PRIYA***.

This is a simple applet for bank application which stores the sensitive data like login ID, password, transaction details of the bank in encrytped format using RSA algorithm. This uses XAMPP as the database in the back-end. 

(Screenshots of the interface of the applet is also included in screenshots section)

### Prerequisites:

- Prior Knowledge about the usage of XAMPP and connecting it into the NetBeans project.
- Basic Java commands
- Basic SQL commands

Here I have used ***NetBeans*** IDE but, you can use any IDE of your choice provided if you know how to connect it with the XAMPP.
